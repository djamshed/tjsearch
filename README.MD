TJ Search
==========

[tjsearch.meteor.com](http://tjsearch.meteor.com)

A quick experiment with [meteor.js](http://meteor.com).

What does it do?
---------------

Search something in Tajik (well, try "офтоб"), this app will ask a dictionary service [lugat.tj](https://lugat.tj) for English and Russian equivalents. XML results will be parsed and links to google.com (using english equivalent) and yandex.ru (using russian word equivalent) will be created. Useful when you only know tajik (well, maybe like 56 people in the world) and are looking for images (neither google, nor yandex know tajik well).
